# OSHWSP-GaitDataset0
Small dataset testing the OSHWSP platform for gait analysis.

As an example of the data that the OSHSWSP system can produce, we show a small set of experimental data. This dataset includes the sampling data of twelve subjects: six female and six male. Each subject was asked to walk at his or her own preferred speed through a straight course in two occasions under the same conditions. The length of the course was approximately 20 meters.

Also, some data about each subject were collected as metadata. These data include the age, gender, weight and height of the subjects, besides measuring the position of the sensors on the body.
